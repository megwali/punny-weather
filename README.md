# Punny Weather

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is powered by the openweathermap api `http://openweathermap.org/forecast5` and presents a 5-day weather forecast. To run the app you will need to sign up with openweathermap for an api key.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
